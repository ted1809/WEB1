    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가?</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element"
      target="_blank" title="html5 specification">HTML5</a> is a software solution stack that defines the properties and
      behaviors of web page content by implementing a markup based pattern
      to it.</p>

    <p style = "margin-top : 40px;">HTML5 was the fifth and last major version
      of HTML that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation.
      The current specification is known as the HTML Living Standard and
      is maintained by a consortium of the major browser vendors
      (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft), the Web Hypertext Application
      Technology Working Group (WHATWG).</p>

    <p>HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[3] with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October 2014.[2][4] Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to     subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.[5]
